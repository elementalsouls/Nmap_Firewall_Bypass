# Handling tcpwrapped Ports

This document explains what "tcpwrapped" means in Nmap scan results and how the Nmap Firewall Bypass Tool addresses this challenge.

## Understanding tcpwrapped

When Nmap reports a port as "tcpwrapped", it means:

1. The TCP handshake completed successfully (indicating the port is open)
2. The connection was closed immediately after establishment
3. No application-layer data was exchanged or the responses were ambiguous

This behavior typically occurs due to:

- **TCP Wrappers**: A host-based access control system
- **Application-layer firewalls**: Terminate connections that don't meet specific criteria
- **Connection proxies**: Intercept connections before passing to the destination
- **IPS/IDS systems**: Block connections after inspecting initial packets

## The Challenge with tcpwrapped

Standard scanning approaches fail because:

1. The TCP handshake succeeds, so the port appears open
2. Service detection fails because no application data is returned
3. Repeated connection attempts often yield the same results

## Bypass Techniques in the Tool

The Nmap Firewall Bypass Tool employs multiple techniques to resolve tcpwrapped ports:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Version Detection

```bash
# Tool implementation:
nmap -sV --version-all --version-intensity 9 --script banner -p [port] [host]
